## <h1 id="header-1_1"> How to talk to computers?</h1>
To perform the intruction, which are given externaly in computers, some hardware is there which convert our external instruction into understandable language of computers. In this hardware, many things are there. For example FPGA board, Arduino board etc. are provides the medium for external inputs and outputs.

Taking the example of Aurdino board. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on the computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

Here in the board, the ATmega328 microcontroller is used. Basically microcontroller is made from package, inside the package chip is there.Chip is made by pads, core, die and foundary IP's.
### Package
The package is a case that surrounds the circuit material to protect it from corrosion or physical damage and allow mounting of the electrical contacts connecting it to the printed circuit board (PCB). here what we are seeing in the black color is the Package of the microcontroller.

### Chip
Inside the Package, chip is available which contains, foundary IP's (for example, RISC-V Soc, PLL, ADC, DAC, SRAM, SPD), core (core contains AND, OR etc. all gates and digital logics), pads (through which input and output signals are communicates).

## What is RISC-V?
RISC-V, where five refers to the number of generations of RISC architecture that were developed at the University of California, Berkeley. RISC is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established RISC principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, RISC-V is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use. A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware, open source operating systems with RISC-V support are available, and the instruction set is supported in several popular software toolchains.

The instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. The base instruction set has a fixed length of 32-bit naturally aligned instructions, and the ISA supports variable length extensions where each instruction can be any number of 16-bit parcels in length. The instruction set specification defines 32-bit and 64-bit address space variants. The specification includes a description of a 128-bit flat address space variant, as an extrapolation of 32 and 64 bit variants, but the 128-bit ISA remains "not frozen" intentionally, because there is yet so little practical experience with such large memory systems.
	
## How software communicate with Hardware?

Between apps or software (in our mobilephones and computers or laptops) and Hardware (in our mobilephones and computers or laptops), One full channel is there, which contains O.S. (operating system), compiler and assembler. This channel proccesses the inputs from the apps and gives the outputs to the Hardware. And according to the output of assembler, the hardware will perform.

<img width="206" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-25 115108" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123488595/214494625-6f94b210-f7fb-4d16-bf4b-c7de6239cd91.png">

when we gives the inputs from the software, inputs is in the C,C++,JAVA etc. languages. Hardware not understand this language. So, this inputs goes throuth the system software cahnnel, where O.S. handles the input/output operations, it allocates the memory to for the codes and low level systems functions are there in O.S. Then program goes to the compiler, where program will compile and generate the HDL program.This HDL program is basically the sets of Instructions which can hardware is able to understand. The instructions are basically depends on what kind of hardware we are using. For example if we are using Mips processor then instruction formaate will be according to the Mips processor, if Hardware is RISC-V then the instruction formate will be according to the RISC-V and similerly for Arm and intel processors also.
	
This sets of instrusctions is now given to the Assembler. here according to the instruction set, assembler will generate the Binary code (contains only 0s and 1s). this binary code can be understandable for hardware. And according to this code, hardware will gives the output.
